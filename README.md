A repository that provides a server for media-endpoints.


# About the Media Endpoints project

The Media Endpoints project is designed as an educational tool that lets novices create WebRTC endpoints without much fuss.

The code evolved from [a single file](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/src/content/capture/video-pc/js/main.js) which can be found in the [WebRTC samples](https://webrtc.github.io/samples) repository at [https://github.com/webrtc/samples](https://github.com/webrtc/samples).
